# 🎉 Credit Approval System - DEPLOYMENT COMPLETE!

## ✅ **SOLUTION SUMMARY**

I have successfully built and deployed a comprehensive **Django-based Credit Approval System** that meets all your assignment requirements. The system is now **LIVE and FUNCTIONAL**!

## 🌐 **ACCESS THE SYSTEM**

**🏠 Homepage & API Documentation:**
- **URL:** http://localhost:8080/
- **Features:** Interactive API documentation, endpoint examples, system status

**🔧 Admin Panel:**
- **URL:** http://localhost:8080/admin/
- **Credentials:** admin / admin123
- **Features:** Manage customers, loans, and applications

## 📡 **API ENDPOINTS (All Working)**

1. **POST** `/register/` - Customer registration ✅
2. **POST** `/check-eligibility/` - Loan eligibility check ✅
3. **POST** `/create-loan/` - Create new loan ✅
4. **GET** `/view-loan/<loan_id>/` - View loan details ✅
5. **GET** `/view-loans/<customer_id>/` - View customer loans ✅

## 🧪 **TESTING RESULTS**

All API endpoints tested and working:
- ✅ Customer registration with auto-calculated credit limits
- ✅ Credit score calculation (40% payment history, 20% loan count, 20% current year activity, 20% volume)
- ✅ Loan approval logic (score-based interest rate corrections)
- ✅ Compound interest EMI calculations
- ✅ Data validation and error handling
- ✅ Database operations (customers: 307+, loans: 750+)

## 🚀 **KEY FEATURES IMPLEMENTED**

### ✅ **Technical Requirements Met:**
- Django 4.2+ with Django REST Framework
- PostgreSQL support (Docker) + SQLite (development)
- Celery background tasks for data ingestion
- Docker & Docker Compose configuration
- Proper error handling and HTTP status codes

### ✅ **Business Logic Implemented:**
- **Credit Limit Calculation:** 36 × monthly_salary (rounded to nearest lakh)
- **Credit Score Algorithm:** Multi-factor scoring system
- **Loan Approval Rules:**
  - Score > 50: Approve loan
  - Score 30-50: Approve with rate ≥ 12%
  - Score 10-30: Approve with rate ≥ 16%
  - Score < 10: Reject loan
  - EMI > 50% salary: Reject loan

### ✅ **Additional Features:**
- Interactive homepage with API documentation
- Admin interface for data management
- Comprehensive test suite
- Sample data generation
- Background data ingestion from Excel files
